# google-news-scraping
The script scrapes the news from the Google News and exports them to the Microsoft Excel in a convenient format.

All you need is to choose what topic you are interested in.
There are 10 of them: "My country news", "World", "My local news", "Business", "Technologies", "Entertainment", "Sports", "Science", "Health" and "Everything".
